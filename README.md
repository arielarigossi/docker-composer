# docker-composing
This repo contains basic .yml files to deploy many services worth managing using docker-compose.yml (and of course docker). 
Keep in mind all sensitive information like users, passwords and addresses are set in dummy strings for example purposes only so you should 
check them out and change them accordingly. They are all mean to work together without port conflicts in case you want to test them all.
Many of those are well known services like PostgresSQL, MySQL and so on, although a brief description will be provided as soon as 
I get time to write about them. They all are amazing projects and deserve a word spreading job to make more people know about them.
